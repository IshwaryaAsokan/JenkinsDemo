Creating a jar for any run of this program you can successfully execute locally should follow these steps.
-Right click the project root, Export as Runnable JAR File with "Package required librariess into generated JAR"
-Place the JAR where it needs to be run from (ex: "\\kowisa04\internetcomm\CPDB\Global\Applications\newschematabbedspreadsheetcreator\dist\")
-Create a shortcut that points to that JAR.

You will need to alter the shortcut target similar to:
\\kowisa04\internetcomm\CPDB\Global\Applications\Java\jre8\bin\java.exe -Xmx1024m  -jar "\\kowisa04\internetcomm\CPDB\Global\Applications\newschematabbedspreadsheetcreator\dist\ANNS-XLSX.jar" > output.txt

3 items to draw your attention to in the shortcut:
1) Please ensure you are using Java 8.
2) If you use javaw.exe instead of java.exe, your output will be suppressed.
3) Appending "> output.txt" to the command is what causes your console log to output to a window.
